## Overview

A political term coined by [[Sam Francis]] to describe a segment of the U.S. working and middle class who feel alienated from both liberal elites and big business.

They are generally patriotic, socially conservative, and economically skeptical of global capitalism, but distrustful of both mainstream political parties and can serve as the base for populist and nationalist movements.
