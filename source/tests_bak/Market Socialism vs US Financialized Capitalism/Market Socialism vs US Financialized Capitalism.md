### Comparison

| Feature                   | **China: Market Socialism**                                 | **U.S.: Financialized Capitalism**                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Credit Channel**   | State-owned banks lend based on government planning         | Private banks + Fed inject liquidity via asset purchases (QE)     |
| **Monetary Transmission** | Directed lending (SOEs, LGFVs, infrastructure)              | QE inflates asset markets; low rates stimulate debt-driven growth |
| **Top-down Intervention** | Gov’t decides where credit flows                            | Fed suppresses interest rates and "backs" the bond market         |
| **Who benefits**          | Politically aligned sectors (SOEs, real estate, local gov.) | Asset holders, Wall Street, deficit-spending politicians          |
| **Hard constraint?**      | None — bad loans are rolled over                            | None — debt monetized, inflation delayed                          |
| **Risk manifestation**    | Zombie firms, debt bubbles, hidden liabilities              | Inflation, asset bubbles, moral hazard                            |
| **Government’s story**    | “Strategic development” and “harmonious growth”             | “Price stability” and “maximum employment”                        |
| **Transparency**          | Opaque, manipulated debt figures                            | Transparent mechanisms, **but** inflation metrics often gamed     |
| **Currency strength**     | Pegged, tightly controlled (RMB)                            | Free-floating, world reserve currency (USD)                       |
| **Resulting Illusion**    | Productive investment and full employment                   | Market-driven prosperity and sustainable deficits                 |


### Similarities
In China: Party officials instruct banks to lend.

In the U.S.: The Fed floods banks with liquidity, pushing yields down to direct credit indirectly.

In both cases, interest rates are not purely market-set; they are tools of policy, distorting true opportunity cost.
