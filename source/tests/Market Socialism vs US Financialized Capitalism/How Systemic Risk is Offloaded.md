Both systems redirect or absorb losses away from the original actor to preserve political or economic stability.

In China, if a developer like Evergrande fails, the local government, state banks, or central planners absorb or postpone the damage.

In the U.S., when the financial system is stressed (2008, 2020, 2023), the Fed buys assets, guarantees liquidity, and allows massive deficit spending, pushing risk onto the national balance sheet or inflationary expectations.

### Similarities
In both systems:

- Failure is politically toxic
- Bailouts are hidden or normalized
- Long-term systemic risk is buried in complexity

> [!danger] Summary
> In both China and the U.S., market discipline has been subordinated to system preservation.


### Comparison

| **Category**              | **China** — Market Socialism                          | **United States** — Financial Capitalism                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credit Allocation**     | Directed by Party/state via SOEs, local gov'ts, banks | Indirect via interest rate policy and liquidity injections |
| **Who issues debt**       | SOEs, LGFVs, local gov'ts (often off-books)           | Treasury + private sector, absorbed by Fed and investors   |
| **Who lends**             | State-owned banks, guided by policy                   | Private banks + bond markets, backstopped by Fed           |
| **How risk is hidden**    | Opaque balance sheets, off-book vehicles, rollovers   | QE suppresses yields; risk mispriced by low rates          |
| **Failure consequences**  | Politically unacceptable → bailouts or rollovers      | Also politically unacceptable → Fed backstops and rescues  |
| **Backstop institution**  | Central government, state banks, PBoC                 | Federal Reserve, Treasury (e.g., TARP, QE, BTFP)           |
| **Asset bubble risk**     | Real estate → hidden bad debt                         | Equities, bonds, real estate → overvaluation               |
| **Crisis signaling**      | Suppressed (controlled media, delayed defaults)       | Masked by asset inflation and delayed CPI recognition      |
| **Transparency**          | Low — systemic risk is unknown                        | Moderate — visible but narrative-managed                   |
| **Public perception**     | “State always ensures stability”                      | “The market works — but the Fed ensures stability”         |
| **Where risk ends up**    | In local gov’t balance sheets, SOEs, PBoC             | On Fed balance sheet, in entitlement promises, inflation   |
| **True stop-loss?**       | None (no market clearing allowed)                     | None (Fed will intervene at signs of panic)                |
| **Long-term consequence** | Capital misallocation, zombie institutions            | Financialization, wealth inequality, loss of pricing power |
